# About Me

I’m an Industrial Engineering student at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly), graduating in June 2026.  

My interests sit at the intersection of:

- **Data & Analytics** – SQL, Python, forecasting, visualization  
- **Operations & Process Engineering** – simulation, optimization, throughput analysis  
- **Human-centered Systems** – usability, workflow design, continuous improvement  

I’ve worked on projects involving:

- Marketing analytics and campaign performance  
- Database design and SQL-based research tools  
- Simulation modeling of real-world systems  
- Process improvement and lean/5S implementations  
- Experimental design and statistical analysis  

You can find detailed write-ups on the [Projects](/projects) page.
