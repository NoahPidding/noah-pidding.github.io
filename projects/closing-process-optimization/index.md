# SLO à la Mode Closing Process Optimization
### IME 223 – Process Improvement Project  

Improved the nightly closing process at SLO à la Mode by reducing wasted motion and standardizing tasks.

## Overview
We observed the closing routine, identified double-backing and motion waste, and proposed changes to streamline the sequence of tasks.

## Tools & Skills
Time & Motion Studies, Spaghetti Diagrams, Lean (5S), MUDA Analysis, Standard Work

## My Contributions
- Observed worker movement during closing and helped map paths using spaghetti diagrams to highlight backtracking.
- Identified tasks with unnecessary travel (mopping, trash, wiping tables, stacking chairs).
- Helped propose an “all-in-one cleaning cart” concept enabling one-pass movement through the store and reducing travel time.
- Contributed to 5S ideas like standardized closing checklists and better organization of cleaning tools and supplies.
