# Bounce Back – Design of Experiments
### IME 326 – DOE Project  

Designed and executed an experiment to understand how surface type affects the bounce height of a ball.

## Overview
The project used structured experimentation to analyze energy transfer across different surface materials.

## Tools & Skills
Design of Experiments, JMP (or similar), Statistical Analysis, Experimental Design

## My Contributions
- Helped define factors and response variables (surface type as factor, bounce height as response).
- Conducted repeated trials per surface type using a fixed drop height and consistent measurement method.
- Participated in analyzing the data to compare bounce heights and interpret how surface hardness affects energy transfer.
