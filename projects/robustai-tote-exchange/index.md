# RobustAI Tote Exchange Workstation Design
### IME 481 Senior Project – Project Team Member  

Worked with RobustAI, a robotics company focused on warehouse automation, to improve the manual tote exchange process for its CARTER robot.

## Overview
The existing load/unload process for robot totes was a bottleneck, with average handling times above targets. Our project explored human–robot workstation concepts to reduce cycle time, increase throughput, and lower operating costs.

## Tools & Skills
Industrial Engineering, Workstation Design, Process Analysis, Concept Development, KPI Definition

## My Contributions
- Helped refine the problem statement around manual tote exchange time, robot idle time, and throughput targets.
- Assisted in defining KPIs (unload/load time, totes per hour, cost per tote) and project constraints.
- Contributed to conceptual solution directions including:
  - An optimized manual workstation (better ergonomics, layout, and workflow).
  - Low-cost gravity-assisted mechanisms for lifting and conveying totes.
  - Concepts for higher automation levels in the long term.
- Supported documentation and presentation of trade-offs between capital cost, throughput gains, and implementation complexity across solution options.
