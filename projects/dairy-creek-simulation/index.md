# Dairy Creek Golf Course Simulation
### IME 420 – Simulation Project  

Simulated the 9-hole Dairy Creek Golf Course to analyze pace of play, bottlenecks, and tee time strategies.

## Overview
Our team built a simulation model to evaluate how tee time spacing, group sizes, and walking vs riding affected congestion, total round time, and rounds completed per day.

## Tools & Skills
Simulation Modeling, AnyLogic (or similar), Queueing Theory, Data Analysis

## My Contributions
- Helped transform Visage GPS and tee sheet data into input distributions for hole times and arrival patterns.
- Assisted in building logic for differing group sizes and walking vs riding behavior.
- Analyzed model outputs including total round time, per-hole time, wait times, and throughput (rounds/day).
- Compared alternative scenarios (e.g., different tee intervals, group size policies, marshal interventions) and their impact on pace of play.
