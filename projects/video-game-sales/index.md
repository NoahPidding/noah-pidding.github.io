# Video Game Sales Trend Analysis
### Personal Data Project  

This project analyzed global and regional video game sales patterns using a public dataset to uncover trends by platform, genre, and geography.

## Overview
I used a Kaggle video game sales dataset (~16,000 rows) to explore how sales change over time, which platforms dominate in different regions, and how genre preferences vary globally.

## Tools & Skills
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Ridge Regression, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering

## My Contributions
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (handled missing years, removed duplicates, standardized platform names).
- Grouped and aggregated data to analyze sales trends by region, platform, and genre.
- Applied one-hot encoding and standardization to prepare data for a Ridge Regression model.
- Trained and evaluated a regression model to explore relationships between features (release year, platform, genre, publisher) and regional sales.
- Built visualizations showing platform dominance over time and genre preferences in North America, Europe, and Japan.
