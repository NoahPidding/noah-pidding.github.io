# Clinical Trials Relational Database
### IME 312 – Clinical Research Database Project  

Designed and implemented a normalized MySQL database using clinical trials data to support complex querying and analysis.

## Overview
Starting from a raw clinicaltrials.gov dataset, our team modeled entities (studies, sponsors, demographics, conditions, outcomes), normalized the schema, and created SQL scripts to build and populate the database.

## Tools & Skills
MySQL, SQL, ERD Modeling, Normalization (3NF), Python (CSV preparation), Data Cleaning

## My Contributions
- Helped design the ERD and define business rules for studies, sponsors, demographics, and measures.
- Normalized multivalued fields (e.g., conditions, age groups, collaborators) into separate lookup + junction tables.
- Assisted in writing SQL `CREATE TABLE` scripts with primary/foreign key constraints and many-to-many relationships.
- Used Python to transform raw CSV data into multiple import-ready tables, ensuring referential integrity.
- Wrote analytical queries to explore most-studied conditions, study phases/types, and prominent outcome themes.
