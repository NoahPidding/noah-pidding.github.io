# Slip-On Sconce Manufacturing Feasibility
### Systems Optimization Club — Team Lead  

As team lead, I helped evaluate the feasibility of relaunching production of a wall-mounted Slip-On Sconce product in the United States.

## Overview
Our goal was to determine whether domestic manufacturing was viable from a cost, capacity, and logistics perspective, and to provide a clear go/no-go recommendation with next steps.

## Tools & Skills
Market Research, Supplier Outreach, Cost Analysis, Capacity Analysis, Excel, Presentation Development

## My Contributions
- Led a five-person team through project scoping, task assignment, and stakeholder communication.
- Conducted market research and analyzed survey responses to understand demand and pricing expectations.
- Coordinated outreach to dozens of potential domestic manufacturers to collect quotes and assess capabilities.
- Synthesized cost, lead time, and capacity data into a recommendation framework that compared domestic options against alternatives.
- Presented a data-driven “No-Go” recommendation for domestic production and outlined next steps, including exploring international manufacturing and refining product/CAD design.
