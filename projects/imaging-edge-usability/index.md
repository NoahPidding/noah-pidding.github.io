## Tools & Skills
Usability Testing, Time Studies, Error Analysis, Workflow Analysis, Human Factors

## My Contributions
- Helped design the testing protocol consisting of two core tasks: connecting the camera and uploading an image.
- Collected data from participants on completion time, errors, and satisfaction across multiple phases of the workflow.
- Analyzed where users struggled (e.g., model selection, connection method choice, locating SSID, image selection).
- Contributed to recommendations such as clearer instructions, improved option visibility, and more prominent image selection controls.
