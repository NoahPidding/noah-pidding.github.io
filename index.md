# Noah Pidding

Industrial Engineering student at Cal Poly specializing in **data analytics, SQL, Python, simulation, and process optimization**.

I enjoy working on projects that combine **data, systems, and people** — from optimizing operations and processes to building analytical models and decision-support tools.
